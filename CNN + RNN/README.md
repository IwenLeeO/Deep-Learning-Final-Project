# Cell-Counting-with-CNN-RNN
A model that uses CNN for feature extraction and RNN to track cells between frames for cell counting. 

# Running The Code
1. Open the ipynb file in Google Colab with GPU runtime type.
2. Put the labels (located here) and raw data in one folder.
2. In cell 1, specify the path to the folder. The assumption is that it will be located in your Google Drive, which is why the code mounts your Drive; if this is not the case, comment that section out if desired.  
3. Run all the code.
